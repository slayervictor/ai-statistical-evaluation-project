# 02445-Project

02445 Project in statistical evaluation for AI and Data

Notes from the first meeting:

Selection of individual cases:

- Case 1 - Lars
- Case 2 - Victor Reynolds
- Case 3 - Lucas

Expectation alignment:

- People have some work but are otherwise quite flexible regarding when we should work.
  * Weekends are generally not preferred.

- Meet more frequently at the beginning to have discussions regarding the scope,
- Gradually split as the technical tasks need to be completed.

# Points we covered:

- Synopsis (January 10th)
- Peer-review (January 11th)
- Individual assignment (January 16th)
- Report (January 17th)
- Exam (January 19th)

# Synopsis:

- Setting - What is the data about, and where does it come from according to the data description?
- Plots - Investigate distributions at the individual level (is it normally distributed?)
  - Boxplots over the different variables
  - Scatter plots for the same
  - Multi-feature analysis, since we have several HR metrics

## Ideas for analysis:

  * Depends on whether the data meets the respective assumptions required by the tests.
  * It is primarily paired, as there are multiple observations of the same individuals.

## Challenges:

  * Depending on whether the data needs to be transformed.
  * Look for outliers.
  * See if all classes are represented.
  * Relatively small dataset - can affect our ability to find significant results and produce models with satisfactory performance.

- Ongoing questions for the instructor:

  * Should we investigate all parameters for HR in the first question?

# Additional points we covered:

- Loaded data
- Create plots on data (boxplot)
- Investigate distributions in classes
- Look for outliers
